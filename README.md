## Timing 30 Minutes
A simple web crawler developed in python3.4 and MySQL

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------------------------
We'd like you to write a simple web crawler in a programming language of your choice. Feel free to either choose one you're very familiar with, The crawler should be limited to one domain - so when crawling "localhost" it would crawl all pages within the domain, but not follow external links, for example to the Facebook and Twitter accounts.
